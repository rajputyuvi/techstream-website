# TechStream — Starter Tech Blog (Prepared for Arun)

This ZIP contains a starter React + Vite project plus static-friendly sample post pages so you can host immediately if you prefer not to build locally.

## What I included
- `index.html` — basic entry that loads the React app if run with Vite.
- `styles.css` — minimal CSS for static preview.
- `src/` — React source files (TechSiteStarter component + main).
- `posts/` — 5 sample posts as static HTML pages.
- `README.md` — this file.

## How to use (easy, no-code)
1. Download the ZIP I provided.
2. Upload the ZIP to Vercel using the "Import Project" -> "Upload" option. Vercel will detect and build the site.
   - OR, if you prefer a static preview, unzip locally and open `index.html` in a browser.
3. If you want help deploying, tell me and I will guide you step-by-step.

## Notes
- I made the post links static-friendly (they point to files under `/posts/`) so they work without extra configuration.
- If you later want the full React behavior (routes, dynamic posts), I can enable React Router and provide instructions.
